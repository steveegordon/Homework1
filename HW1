		<h1> Stuff That I Think is Cool</h1>
			<br>
			<p> I fit the general description of a dork, dweeb, or nerd. There are a number of traditional forms of geek entertainment all of which tend to be very visual and text based. Here is a list of some such things:
			</p>
				<ol type="I">
					<li> Video Games</li>
					<li> Sci-Fi/Fantasy</li>
					<li> Computers(obviously)</li>
					<li> Random Weird Cat Pics</li>
				</ol>
			<p> In case the last one confuses you <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=random+weird+cat+pics" target="_blank">here</a> is a crash course.

		<h2> More About Me</h2>
